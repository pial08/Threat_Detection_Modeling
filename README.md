# Learning Source Code Vulnerability Localization and Causation with Explainability


The widespread adoption of smart connected IoT devices
underscores the need to address code vulnerabilities to protect secu-
rity and privacy. These code vulnerabilities can cause unauthorized ac-
cess, data breaches, network disruptions, and privacy violations. In this
paper, we address the challenge of identifying source code vulnerabil-
ities by offering clear code vulnerability indicators and causation. In
our system, we create the code property graph (CPG) of the entire
source repository. We perform a thorough analysis by extracting func-
tions from the source code and classifying vulnerable functions. Subse-
quently, we pass the vulnerable functions through an ensemble trans-
former and graph model to pinpoint the vulnerabilityâ€™s location and
provide the root cause of the existence of the vulnerability through ex-
plainability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system
by detecting 24 N-day and 3 zero-day vulnerabilities by analyzing six
IoT repositories, including TinyOS, Contiki, Zephyr, FreeRTOS, RIOT-
OS, and Raspberry Pi OS from GitHub




#### Requirements
- Python 	3.7
- Pytorch 	1.9 
- Transformer 	4.4
- torchmetrics 0.11.4
- tree-sitter 0.20.1
- sctokenizer 0.0.8

Moreover the above libraries can be installed by the commands from *requirements.txt* file. It is assumed that the installation will be done in a Linux system with a GPU. If GPU does not exist please remove the first command from the *requirements.txt*  file and replace it with 

`conda install pytorch==1.9.1 torchvision==0.10.1 torchaudio==0.9.1 -c pytorch` for OSX

or 


`conda install pytorch==1.9.0 torchvision==0.10.1 torchaudio==0.9.1 cpuonly -c pytorch` for Linux and Windows with no GPU.

Instructions to install libraries using *requirements.txt* file.

```shell
cd code 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
